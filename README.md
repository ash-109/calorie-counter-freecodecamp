Learn Form Validation by Building a Calorie Counter


Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, you'll learn how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

In this project, you'll learn to create a calorie counter form that enables users to input their daily calorie budget and the calorie counts of various meals. The form will then calculate and display whether the user is in a calorie deficit or surplus.

You'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
